      "description": "üëã I'm Jason Wilson. My expertise are in front-end/back-end frameworks like Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React.js. I have an associates degree in Electronic Systems Technology and my Software Engineering certification from the school Code Fellows. I spent the first 6 years of my career in the Air Force, working on transmitter/reciever radios using VHF(Very High Frequency)/UHF(Ultra High Frequency), ILS (systems designed for guiding pilots landing on a runway). After the military, I became a Field Service Engineer where I installed, maintained, and aided in the optomization of automated inspection camera systems that were designed to inspect products for any defects. I've always admired technology and was exceedingly curious about what kind of future our civilization will experience. I wanted to be in a field of producers, creators, and visionaries as opposed to the consumers. So I chose a field that would give me that opportunity, software engineering. I believe that with software engineering, instead of being a piece of history...I'll become a part of the future.
